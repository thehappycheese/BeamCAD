======== Design goal tiers ========

The idea for this thesis topic came to me during one of the many times i have created a spreadsheet to perform some kind of engineering design. The process involves a combination of theoretical knowledge and the application of design standards. The relationship between design standards and the theoretical knowledge is entirely obtuse. Furthermore the standards themselves are presented in a strict linear "book" format. Reading a standard from cover to cover will prove entirely fruitless to a new engineer.

To this end i intend to create a map. Not just a map but a trainsystem. The trainsystem would give a student an accellerated tour of the standard in order to familiarise them with the process of the design.

It would be easy to write software wich assists a student to design a beam to standard. There are several industry software which already allow automated design. The challenge with this software is to assist a student to learn the equivalent hand calculations


Thesis goals

1.	To accelerate the learning process of university students in the design of
	concrete beams through the use of a piece of software.
2.	To investigate the potential of software in teaching and "knowledge transfer"
3.	To investigate the possibility of collaboration between software engineers and
	civil engineers for an assignment. This type of project would be of enourmouse
	benefit to the students involved and if successful, the entire field of civil 
	engineering in the long term


Primary goals in order of priority for this project.

1.	Ultimate strength design procedure
	1.1	Bending moment design
	1.2	Shear design

2.	Ultimate strength check  procudure
	1.1	Bending moment checks
	1.2	Shear checks

3.	Load combinations
4.	Servicability and deflection design

Ancilliary goals that are not likely to be adressed in this itteration of the project





======== AS 1700 =========

Load combinations

2.2		Design for strength
	
	P1	2.1.1
		Explanation of process with the following formulas:
			R_d >= E_d
			R_d = phi R_u
			R_u is determined from the standard
			E_d is determined by static, linear elastic or approved simplified methods 	as a result of the critical combined load from AS 1170.0

	P1	T2.2.2	Capacity reduction factors (phi)

	OS	2.2.3	Linear elastic stress
	OS	2.2.4	Strut and tie procedure

2.3		Design for servicability

		2.3.2	Deflection limits
			T2.3.2 Deflection limits
				P1	Deflection limits should be in mind when starting design
