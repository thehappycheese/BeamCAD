A_g {
	Cross stectional area of
	Concrete beam
	(gross area)
}


A_st {
	Cross stectional area of
	Tensile steel 
}


A_sc {
	Cross stectional area of
	Compressive steel 
}



B {
	Breadth of a rectangular section
}



B_eff{
	Effective breadth of a non rectangular section
	For a T-Beam or slab/beam this is the width of the flange
	<>
}


d {
	Effective depth in plain of bending;
	measured from the outermost compression fiber to the centroid of the tensile steel
	this measure becomes confusing when dealing with compression steel and multiple layers
}


d_n {
	Depth from outermost compression fiber to the neutral axis of the beam
	This is the imaginary hinge of the see-saw in the beam
}


D {
	The overall depth of a beam in the plane of bending.
}


E_c{
	Mean elastic modulus
	at 28 days of
	Concrete
	<>
}


f_sy{
	Characteristic yield strength of
	Reinforcement bars
	<AS3600: 3.2.1>
	
	For more info see <AS4671>
}


f'c {
	Characteristic compressive strength at 28 days after concrete pour.
	
	Determined in accordance with specification (AS1379)
	or
	Determined in statistically from tests (AS1012.9)
	
	AS3600 1.1.2	limits f'c to  between 20MPa and 100MPa.
	AS3600 3.1.1.1	lists standard grades: [20,25,32,40,50,65,80,100]MPa
