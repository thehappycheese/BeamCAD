A_g {
	Cross stectional area of
	Concrete beam
	(gross area)
}


A_st {
	Cross stectional area of
	Tensile steel 
}


A_sc {
	Cross stectional area of
	Compressive steel 
}



B {
	Breadth of a rectangular section
}



B_eff{
	Effective breadth of a non rectangular section
	For a T-Beam or slab/beam this is the width of the flange
	<>
}


d {
	Effective depth in plain of bending;
	measured from the outermost compression fiber to the centroid of the tensile steel
	this measure becomes confusing when dealing with compression steel and multiple layers
}


d_n {
	Depth from outermost compression fiber to the neutral axis of the beam
	This is the imaginary hinge of the see-saw in the beam
}


D {
	The overall depth of a beam in the plane of bending.
}


E_c{

	Concrete

}


f_sy{
	Characteristic yield strength of
	Reinforcement bars
	<AS3600: 3.2.1>
